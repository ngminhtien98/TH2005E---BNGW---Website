    <h1>Presentation</h1>
    <p>
        I am a student graduated from University of Social Sciences and Humanities - Vietnam National University of Hanoi. I have more than a year working as personal assistant for D.CEO at a technology company, Hanoi. While I was working there, I had opportunities to approach many developers and their work. I also took part in a few projects revolved around mobile app developing. I found out I really interested in that field. I have spent more than a month for self-studying about code. Then, I decided to take part in ADSE course at FPT Aptech Academy. Now I am a student there and hope to be a developer soon!
